## Purpose
The Purpose of this portfolio is to provide prospect employers the opportunity to learn more of my skills and interests as an upcoming developer. The website has been designed with a minimalist approach to keep the website looking clean and easy to navigate. To maintain my brand as ‘the strong coder’ as I’m known on social media, I have provided content which displays my personal brand, showcasing not just the developer, but also the powerlifter. The design remains consistent, utilising colours of pink, black, and white.

## Design and Decisions
### Colour Scheme: 
The black, white, and soft pink colour scheme are a combination that could speak to a range of different people. I chose this colour scheme as it is easy to read, and doesn’t conflict with the content. This colour scheme is a brand choice for “The Strong Coder’. 

### Components
The components used within the website have been selected based upon functionality and to provide context to the audience. 

## Specifications

The website has been built utilising HTML5 and CSS3 
## Audience
The website has been designed and developed for “The Strong Coder”, to provide an online portfolio for prospective employers to gain a greater understanding of the person, not just the developer. The website has been designed to allow users to navigate to social media, and view the creative and technical capabilities. 
## Components
### Navigation Menu

I have opted for a simplistic navigation with key features to provide that extra touch to a website. The navigation menu is utilising white text, and the hover feature provides a simple black line above the selection. Using the scroll feature contained in another component, the menu moves with the screen. 
### Scroll Container
The scroll container I’ve used is a block colour taking the full screen with a very smooth scroll action to provide a delicate touch to a simple website. I’ve opted to utilise this component across all pages to provide consistency. 
### Barbell Animation
Using CSS I was able to implement a barbell as part of the page titles for the About, Blog, and Contact pages of the website. This has been implemented as a design feature to not only showcase technical capabilities, but also provide context to the person behind the website. It is well known that I enjoy and compete in strength sports, so utilising a barbell will provide the audience with a greater level of understanding behind the name “the strong coder”. 
### Blog Cards
In order to provide the audience with an understanding, blog cards have been utilised showing images relevant to the blog post/article. For these posts, I have opted for images of powerlifting, or the coder academy team to showcase both powerlifting and web development. The user can view the owner and published date. 
### Changing Words
This component has been used to provide context to the audience about who I am, and what I do. This has been chosen to provide a greater view by using keywords, specifically chosen to impact the viewer of my current abilities and passions. 
### Contact Form
The contact form has been utilised to provide the audience an opportunity to contact through the website. When a text box is selected, the border will light up.
